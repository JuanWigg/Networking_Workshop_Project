# Networking Workshop Project
This is a repository of my Networking Workshop Project. 
Networking Workshop is an optional subject in my degree, in which we learn to use basic services of AWS, and make services like Reverse Proxies, NATs, VoIP services, among others.
Hope you like the project.

Also, if you want to see the report for the project you can see it on [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12m2y0v_4A9oQpFtlERbOmXfp5ZF_XjUImMVDh3N2cv4/edit?usp=sharing)
