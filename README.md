# Networking Workshop Project
This is a repository of my Networking Workshop Project. 
Networking Workshop is an optional subject in my degree, in which we learn to use basic services of AWS, and make services like Reverse Proxies, NATs, VoIP services, among others.
We used this project to practice our Terraform skills for deploying a infraestructure on a Cloud environment.
Hope you like the project.

Also, if you want to see the report for the project (written in spanish) you can see it on [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12m2y0v_4A9oQpFtlERbOmXfp5ZF_XjUImMVDh3N2cv4/edit?usp=sharing)
